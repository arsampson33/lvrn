      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Eli Derby earned a coveted spot on LVRN's roster where he released dreamy, '90s R&B-influenced tracks like "Gaslight" and the 6LACK collaboration "Lately." Both were included on his 2022 debut EP Left on Read.

        Derby grew up in Oxon Hill, Maryland, playing drums and later piano and bass at his local church. With encouragement from his musical parents, he began singing and learned to play the guitar as well, posting covers online and producing his own music. Derby was a teenager when he signed a major-label deal with 's Love Renaissance (known colloquially as ) imprint. He first appeared alongside labelmates like 6LACK, Summer Walker, and Shelley FKA Dram on the LVRN's 2020 Christmas compilation Home for the Holidays, then released his own debut single, "Gaslight," in 2021. Tonally indebted to '90s R&B, Derby's sophisticated songs also veer into hip-hop and bedroom pop. Two more singles, "Love Song" and "Lately," appeared in early 2022 ahead of his first EP, Left on Read. ~ Timothy Monger, Rovi</p>
