      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>When you think of Vermont, you think of maple syrup, mountains, and massive amounts of snow. Moreover, its quietude typically inspires quaint lives. North Ave Jax chose a much louder path. The Burlington native took the unexpected route personally and creatively, threading deft verbal dexterity through unpredictable soundscapes punctuated by punk rock spirit, pop ambition, and even a twist of R&B. At two-years-old, he picked up drums and continued to play through grade school—even joining a rock band in first grade. Mom introduced him to the likes of Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, while a trip to the local library actually unlocked hip-hop for him. After hearing Flo Rida’s “Low” on library headphones, he embraced rap, listening to JAY-Z, Drake, Nas, A Tribe Called Quest, Brent Faiyaz, and more. Throughout high school, basketball occupied the bulk of his time, yet he still managed to ignite a handful of viral freestyle videos from the lunchroom. Kicked off the basketball team in senior year, he dropped out of school. One night in 2021, he wound up recording in a friend’s makeshift closet studio. Hunger to succeed drove his delivery from the jump. Serendipitously, an acquaintance FaceTimed LVRN Co-Founder and President Tunde Balogun and played him Jax’s music. A day later, the label flew him to Atlanta in order to ink a deal. Now, North Ave Jax introduces a scorching signature style on a series of 2021 singles and more to come.</p>
