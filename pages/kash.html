      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>As BRS Kash’s career has taken off, the melodically blessed Atlanta rapper has strutted into the spotlight with confidence—a sense that his star is rising and you can either jump on or fall off. His voice is silky-toned, his bars are always diamond-sharp, and he’s hellbent on proving his versatility as a songwriter. For instance, his first hit, the lascivious “Throat Baby,” is a club banger with a pensive piano line, and his forthcoming cuts move between dancefloor bounce and introspective reflection. Regardless of what topics he touches, BRS Kash does it with a natural ear for hooks and remarkable ease. “I don't want people to judge me off of ‘Throat Baby’ alone because there’s so much more you can get from Kash,” he says. The melody-making MC knows not to waste his shot, and so he’s spent countless nights on end in the studio since, prepping to take the throne. His new songs, which he’s been working on in Los Angeles, move from the kind of playful club bops we’ve already heard to emotional tracks that dive deep into his own past. Having seen how much success he’s accrued on his own―off just one song, no less―the young Atlanta MC won’t be deterred. “I have to do this on my own,” he says. “And nobody can stop me.”
